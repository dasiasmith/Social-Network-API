  ## Description

  This application builds an API for a social network where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. It utilizes Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. A video demonstration can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H7fOICaB4822x4oWwAcSRsIqt1RgQycB/view?usp=sharing)
